# OCaml Difference List

A pure functional list-like data structure supporting O(1) concatenation. This is particularly useful for efficient list construction from many lists. It is an immutable data type without any side effect.

Inspired by [Haskell dlist](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/dlist-0.5).
